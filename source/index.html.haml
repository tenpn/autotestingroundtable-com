        Automated Testing is back for the fifth year of roundtables at GDC 2019!
      %p
        Each session focuses on a different discipline, but cut across team sizes, budgets, genres, and platforms. We don't care if you're a iOS-only one-person indie or a console juggernaut, we just want to hear your voice!

            Beyond the software that we use to test our games are the people that write the tests and the workflows they use to reinforce them. How does the process work in your studio? Are the engineers responsible for automated tests, or QA? Are QA silo'd or integrated? What could be better?

            As much as we would like otherwise, automated testing is still a rarity in our industry. Do you have a culture or a codebase that doesn't currently embrace automated testing? Are you having trouble getting people onboard, or maybe it was very easy and you want to share why? Grand failures are just as interesting as successes!

          %p
            Software automation has many faces, from locally-run functional and unit tests, to server-driven continuous integration, and even external device farms. How do you do automated testing in your team? What works well for you? More interestingly, what didn't work and why?

            It seem everyone has a failure story about how they attempted automated testing of gameplay and came away with their tails between their legs. 
          %p
            Rare already has automated testing pedegree, so this looks like an exciting chance to learn about how gameplay testing can work.

            Bots at GDC seem to be a theme this year! This is an hour session, compared to the 30min for the Battlefield session on Tuesday, so looks to go into more detail. However not everyone can access the main conference talks.
          %p
            We'd recommend going to both if you can!

            A talk by veteran roundtabler Adrian Yu on how EA uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment - vital tools in the belt of any serious automated tester.
          %p
            His talk sounds interesting because it's more than just a dive into Jenkins, as he promises to explain how they manage spam and notifications to make them truely useful, rather than noisy.
