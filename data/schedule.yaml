      desc: This looks like a great intro to continuous integration and delivery from AWS. Obviously it's going to lean on their services hard, but you shouldn't let that stop you attending if the takeaways sound useful.

      desc: Another AWS talk, but sponsored talks are always free even to expo pass holders, so they can be very useful. And there's no reason why automated testing shouldn't extend to cover player-to-player interaction as well!
